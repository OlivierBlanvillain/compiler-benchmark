JMH benchmarks for the Scala Compiler
==============

Goal: define a set of JMH benchmarks for the compiler to help drive performance
tuning and catch performance regressions.

Based on:
 - [OpenJDK JMH](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/) is "the definitive" Java benchmarking tool.
 - via sbt-jmh can be found on: [https://github.com/ktoso/sbt-jmh](https://github.com/ktoso/sbt-jmh).
